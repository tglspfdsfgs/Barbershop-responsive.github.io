# Barbershop "Borodinski" 

The barbershop "Borodinsky" is the frontend project for a website that  is aimed at reinforcing the fundamentals of web development, including HTML and CSS, and honing skills in SASS, BEM block structure, and flexboxes. The site is fully responsive, catering to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices

## Site Structure:

1.  **Main Page**: Features a promotional block, news section, and a reviews carousel.
2.  **Our Works**: Showcases the portfolio of works and includes a price list.
3.  **Make an Appointment**: Provides a form for scheduling appointments.

This project has been valuable learning experience, enhancing my frontend development skills.
